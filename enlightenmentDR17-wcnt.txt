# if application don't appear on list it is autogenerated
# autogeneration means put as window class executable name with first letter
# upper case and rest lower case, which is correct for applications
# where class is not explicitily specified

# when it has to appear on this list ?
#  - if class differs from autogenerated class
#  - if few applications have same window class
#  - if it's a terminal and you don't want it to be confused with terminal
#    application

# structure:
# one application per line, there are 5 columns with this order and meaning:
#  1. desktop file name, without '.desktop' ending
#  2. window class
#  3. window name
#  4. window title bar
#  5. window role
#
# - columns are separated by one or more white space,
# - if white space appears in a column it has tu be put in "" quotation marks
# - '*' means unset
# - enlightenment understands regexp like shell ones ([ab], *)
